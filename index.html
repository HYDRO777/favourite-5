        Favourite thing to do
    </p1>
    <hr>
    <p2>
        My favourite thing to do is play videogames, cook, code, play boardgames, cycle and spend time with my family. My favourite videogame is Fortnite. Fortnite is an online multiplayer game in which ur goal is to be the last one standing. I enjoy this game a lot as I caa play it with my friends. My favourite skin in Fortnite is the Joltara skin. My favourite boardgame is Catan, Uno Flip and Monoply as they go for long and there are few moves which can change the whole game. I like coding things as I can use my own imagination to make things. Cycling is my favourite workout because I love the wind which comes on to my face and I feel like I am riding a real MotorBike when I go faster. I love cooking things as I love food. I can cook many foods and deserts. I love to spend time with my family because they are my family and I love them a lot.
